Here are the essential Git commands you'll need to manage your workspace:

To update your workspace with latest changes from GitHub:
git pull origin main

To push your local changes to GitHub:
git add .                    # Stage all changes
git commit -m "your message" # Commit changes with a message
git push origin main        # Push to GitHub

To check status of your workspace:
git status                  # See what files have changed
git log                     # See commit history

To discard local changes and reset to last GitHub version:
git fetch origin           # Get latest from GitHub
git reset --hard origin/main  # Reset to GitHub version (WARNING: discards local changes)
